# Overview
Running the 'main.py' file should give you access to everything you'll need, but more details will follow

## MIDI File Input
Any MIDI files can be places into src/input. From here, they can be selected in the main file
An example MIDI file of Ode to Joy has been provided

## Output Folder
Here you can find saved models, plots, and generated MIDI
* Models are saved as .pth files to be read by pyTorch
* Plots are stored as .png files
* Generated .midi files can be opened in any MIDI editor. I recommend MuseScore for notation, but Pianotify is an online resource
